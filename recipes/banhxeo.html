        <h2 class="cooking-steps">Steps</h2>
        <ul class="steps">
          <li>
            Step 1: Make the crêpe batter: Mix rice flour, sugar, salt, and
            turmeric together in a large bowl. Beat in coconut milk until thick.
            Slowly beat in water until it reaches the consistency of a thin
            crêpe batter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 2: Make the filling: Heat 1 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large
            skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallot and garlic; cook and stir
            until fragrant but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add shrimp; sauté
            until cooked through and opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with fish
            sauce and salt. Transfer filling to a bowl.
          </li>
          <li>Step 3: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
          <li>
            Step 4: Wipe out the skillet and reheat over medium heat. Add
            remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil. Stir crêpe batter and pour 1/2 cup
            into the hot skillet, swirling to coat the bottom. Lay 3 or 4 cooked
            shrimp on the bottom half of the crêpe. Top with a small handful of
            bean sprouts. Cook until batter looks set and edges start to brown,
            about 1 minute. Fold crêpe over and slide onto an oven-safe plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 5: Place crêpe in the preheated oven to keep warm. Repeat with
            remaining batter, shrimp, and bean sprouts
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 6: Serve crêpes with lettuce leaves. Break off pieces of crêpe
            and roll them up in lettuce to eat.
